//! Light client logic and implementation.
//!
//! A "light" client stores very little chain-related data locally
//! unlike a full node, which stores all blocks, headers, receipts, and more.
//!
//! This enables the client to have a much lower resource footprint in
//! exchange for the cost of having to ask the network for state data
//! while responding to queries. This makes a light client unsuitable for
//! low-latency applications, but perfectly suitable for simple everyday
//! use-cases like sending transactions from a personal account.
//!
//! It starts by performing a header-only sync, verifying random samples
//! of members of the chain to varying degrees.

// TODO: remove when integrating with the rest of parity.
